## Overview

This is my independent research project examining the adoption of FinTech services (mobile wallets, digital banking) and its effect on traditional banking in Nepal.Using primary survey data from **111 respondents** (collected in 2024-2025), I analyzed key drivers of FinTech adoption, user satisfaction, challenges, and most importantly — whether FinTech has actually reduced physical visits to bank branches.The project combines data cleaning, visualization, statistical tests, and econometric modeling to derive meaningful insights about financial inclusion and digital transformation in Nepal.

**Relevant Coursework**: Business Statistics, Corporate Finance, Financial Management, Research Methodology (BBS Finance, Tribhuvan University).

## Methodology

- **Data**: Primary survey (111 responses) covering demographics, usage frequency, satisfaction, adoption reasons, challenges, and branch visit reduction.
- **Tools**: Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, statsmodels
- **Techniques**:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization
  - Chi-square test of independence
  - Logistic Regression (addressed quasi-complete separation using regularization)

## Key Findings

- Over **80%** of respondents reported that FinTech has significantly or somewhat reduced their visits to physical bank branches.
- Top adoption drivers: **Convenience (24/7 access)** and **Faster transactions**.
- Major challenges: Hidden charges/fees, poor internet connectivity, and security concerns.
- High satisfaction level with FinTech services compared to traditional banking.
- Chi-square test showed no significant relationship between occupation (e.g. students) and reduction in branch visits.
- Logistic regression revealed very high baseline probability of reduced branch visits (Odds Ratio ≈ 7.54 for intercept).

## Skills Demonstrated

- Survey design & primary data collection
- Data wrangling and visualization
- Inferential statistics & econometric modeling
- Handling real-world modeling issues (quasi-separation)

This project strengthened my quantitative research skills and gave me practical experience in applying statistics and regression to real economic/finance questions.
